Increases were primarily due to 2022 special item costs for\nsignificant litigation from additional commitments to address PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (discussed in Note 16), higher raw materials and logistics\ncosts, manufacturing productivity headwinds which were further magnified by the shutdown of certain operations in Belgium and progress on restarting previously-idled\noperations, and investments in growth, productivity and sustainability.

This new program authorizes the\nrepurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In the first six months of 2023, the Company purchased $29 million of its\nown stock, compared to $773 million of stock purchases in the first six months of 2022. As of June 30, 2023, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the\nauthorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive\nyear of dividend increases for 3M. In May 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales:\nRefer to the preceding Overview section and the Performance by Business Segment section later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change.\nOperating Expenses:\nThree months ended\nJune 30,\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n(Percent of net sales)\n2023\n2022\nChange\n2023\n2022\nChange\nCost of sales\n55.3 %\n58.5 %\n(3.2)%\n56.4 %\n56.6 %\n(0.2)%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)\n146.6 \n34.7 \n111.9 \n85.0 \n27.9 \n57.1 \nResearch, development and related expenses (R&D)\n5.7 \n5.5 \n0.2 \n5.8 \n5.5 \n0.3 \nOperating income (loss) margin\n(107.6)%\n1.3 %\n(108.9)%\n(47.2)%\n10.0 %\n(57.2)%\nStock compensation expense was $41 million and $47 million for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was $176 million and $182 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which impacts cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses\n(R&D). The Companys annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive\nvesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the annual\ngrant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter each year.\n3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense in 2023 to decrease by approximately $160 million pre-tax when compared to 2022, which\nimpacts cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The year-on-year decrease in defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for the second quarter and first six\nmonths of 2023 was approximately $38 million and $80 million, respectively.\nFor total year 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248\nmillion related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated\ndefined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million.\nFor total year 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and\npostretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense\nof approximately $145 million, a decrease in expense of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales,\nSG&A, and R&D.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were\nprimarily due to lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending\ndiscipline and restructuring benefits. These decreases were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs; manufacturing productivity headwinds; investments in\ngrowth, productivity and sustainability; and restructuring charges.\n62\n"}]}

Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are\nnot included in this Form 10-K can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\nOverview\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industrys broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate\nprincipal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes,\nconsisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of\n4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes).

Sales to this customer consisted of sales of products\nfrom our Gaming segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers\nWe focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system integrators, who target commercial\nand consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners business; however, we are\nincreasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we\nhave increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and services solutions into Enterprise, high\nperformance computing (HPC) and Cloud Service Provider Customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers\nand workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\nThird-Party Distributors\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and OEMs, ODMs, and other customers. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products,\nand may include products from other manufacturers that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most\ninstances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide certain return rights with respect to any\nproduct that we have removed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain\nstandard stock rotation provisions permitting limited product returns.\nAdd-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system\nintegrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell\ndirectly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles\nand can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their\ncustomers.\nCompetition in Data Center Segment\nIn Data Center, we compete against Intel Corporation (Intel) with our FPGA, Adaptive SoC, CPU and DPU server products and NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA)\nwith our CPU, GPU and DPU server products. A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based\ndesigns are being used in the server market, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.\nCompetition in Client Segment\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our primary competitor in the supply of CPUs is Intel. A variety of companies provide or have\ndeveloped ARM-based microprocessors and platforms.

Our investments in product innovation, technology,\npeople and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with\ncustomers and expanded merchant acceptance.\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction\nin net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable\ncredit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ). Billed business, which\nrepresented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent\non an FX-adjusted basis ), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed\nbusiness grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business\nin our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise\ncustomers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent\nyear-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending\nmomentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the\nlarge pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the\ncontinuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our\ninternational billings.\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue\nlines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending\nvolumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member\nretention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased\n36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by\ngrowth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a\nmodest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong\ngrowth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased\nversus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in\n2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our\ncustomer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year.\nThe foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign\nexchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP\nmeasure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period\nwithout the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1 \n42\n"}]}

This growth has \nbeen driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment. For fiscal 2024, we expect this \nprofit-sharing revenue to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year, as the benefit from the first half of the year is \nexpected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year.\n \nOur SG&A in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately flat to last year, as higher incentive compensation was primarily offset by lower store payroll \nexpense.\n \nOur SG&A in the first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased primarily due to lower store payroll expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. \n \nThe reduction in restructuring charges in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily related to higher-than-expected employee retention \nfrom our fiscal 2023 resource optimization initiative. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in \nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n \nOur operating income rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, due to an increase in gross profit rate and lower restructuring charges, partially offset \nby an unfavorable SG&A rate. \n \nOur operating income rate decreased in the six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses and \nhigher incentive compensation expense, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate, partially offset by favorability in gross profit rate.\n \nInternational Segment\n \nSelected financial data for the International segment was as follows ($ in millions):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThree Months Ended\n \nSix Months Ended\n \nJuly 29, 2023\n \nJuly 30, 2022\n \nJuly 29, 2023\n \nJuly 30, 2022\nRevenue\n$\n 693 \n $\n 760 \n $\n 1,359 \n $\n 1,513 \nRevenue % change\n \n (8.8)% \n (9.3)% \n (10.2)% \n (7.4)%\nComparable sales % change\n \n (5.4)% \n (4.2)% \n (5.5)% \n (2.8)%\nGross profit\n$\n 168 \n $\n 178 \n $\n 326 \n $\n 361 \nGross profit as a % of revenue\n \n 24.2 % \n 23.4 % \n 24.0 % \n 23.9 %\nSG&A\n$\n 149 \n $\n 150 \n $\n 287 \n $\n 299 \nSG&A as a % of revenue\n \n 21.5 % \n 19.7 % \n 21.1 % \n 19.8 %\nRestructuring charges\n$\n - \n $\n - \n $\n (1) \n $\n 1 \nOperating income\n$\n 19 \n $\n 28 \n $\n 40 \n $\n 61 \nOperating income as a % of revenue\n \n 2.7 % \n 3.7 % \n 2.9 % \n 4.0 %\n \nThe decreases in revenue in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 were primarily driven by comparable sales declines of 5.4% and 5.5%, \nrespectively, and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. \n \n18\n"}]}

In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based\non Embraers failure to meet certain required closing conditions.

Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\nthe information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\norders and\/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n6\n"},{"evidence_text":"We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government","doc_name":"BOEING_2022_10K","evidence_page_num":9,"evidence_text_full_page":"Table of Contents\ncommercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely\ndeliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and\/or the\nfinancial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.\nOperational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in additional production\ndelays and\/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins.\nOur commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure\nto meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory approval, could result in additional out-of-sequence work\nand increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and\/or increased warranty or fleet\nsupport costs. We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID-19, global supply\nchain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and\nstability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our commercial aircraft fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements and\/or potentially required sustainability standards, we could\nface additional costs and\/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and\nreliability standards and\/or potentially required sustainability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly\nand technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to\nsatisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and\/or lower revenues.\nChanges in levels of U.S. government defense spending or acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and\nresults of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the United States\nDepartment of Defense (U.S. DoD). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such\nas the evolving nature of the national security threat environment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political\nenvironment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and\nappropriations bills.\nThe timeliness of FY24 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations\nfor government departments or agencies would result in a full or partial government shutdown, which could impact the Companys operations.\nAlternatively, Congress may fund government departments and agencies with one or more Continuing Resolutions; however, this would restrict\nthe execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. In addition, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to\noverall levels of defense spending in FY24 and beyond. U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, is likely to\ncontinue to be subject to pressure.\nThere continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other\ngovernment agencies (including NASA), including changes to national security and defense priorities, and tension between modernization\ninvestments, sustainment investments, and investments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or\nbudget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and\/or\ndelays of existing contracts or programs, or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the\nCompanys financial position, results of operations and\/or cash flows.\n8\n"},{"evidence_text":"In 2022, 40% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts","doc_name":"BOEING_2022_10K","evidence_page_num":13,"evidence_text_full_page":"Table of Contents\nguarantees, partner performance and indemnifications.

We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may\nresult in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the\ntransaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations,\nhigher costs or asset write-downs.\nRisks Related to Our Contracts\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\nIn 2022, 40% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include FMS through the U.S. government. Business\nconducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs.\nNew procurement regulations or climate or cyber-related contractual disclosures, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our\ncompliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may also\nresult in withheld payments and\/or reduced future business if we fail to comply. For example, proposals to raise domestic content thresholds for\nour U.S. government contracts could have negative impacts on our business. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future\nprocurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and\/or cash flows.\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or\nterminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In\naddition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations\nprocess due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and\/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to\nongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as\ncontinuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and\/or modification,\ncurtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations\nand\/or cash flows.\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.\ngovernment contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,\nroutinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable\nlaws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found\nto be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must\nbe refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business.\nFurthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and\nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment\nfrom doing business with the U.S. government.

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and\nthe 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a\ntype certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircrafts flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were\nsubmitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting\nspecifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft\nmust include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in\nBoeings application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning\nthree years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety\nenhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have\nprovisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience\ndelays in achieving certification and\/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be\nadversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes.

The consolidated multidistrict litigation captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) is\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. This multidistrict litigation presumptively includes hundreds of relevant federal court cases\nthat name the Company as a defendant. A significant number of similar cases that name the Company as a defendant in some capacity are pending in state\ncourts.\nIn addition, the Company has been named as a defendant in similar cases brought by certain state Attorneys General. The Company is defending itself against\nall such claims. Additionally, the Company has received subpoenas, CIDs, and\/or other requests for information regarding opioids from state Attorneys General\nand insurance and other regulators of several U.S. jurisdictions. The Company has been cooperating with the government with respect to these subpoenas,\nCIDs, and other requests for information.\nIn November 2021, the Company was among the chain pharmacies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; in August 2022, the court issued a\njudgment jointly against the three defendants in the amount of $651 million to be paid over 15 years, and also ordered certain injunctive relief. The Company is\nappealing the judgment and has not accrued a liability for this matter. In March 2022, CVS Health Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve claims related to opioid medications dating back more than a decade. Under the terms of the\nsettlement agreement, CVS Health Corporation settled all opioid claims against it and its subsidiaries by the State of Florida for $484 million, which is to be\npaid over a period of 18 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $484 million liability associated with this legal\nsettlement. In August 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of New Mexico to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents\nand subsidiaries by the State of New Mexico and participating subdivisions. In September 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State\nof West Virginia to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of West Virginia and participating subdivisions. Also in\nSeptember 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the Cherokee Nation to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries\nby the Cherokee Nation.\nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a\nleadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs Executive Committee (PEC). The agreement would resolve substantially all\nopioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts\nwould be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023. The agreement also contains injunctive terms relating to the dispensing of opioid medications. The\nsettlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com.\nUnder the settlement agreement, before the Company determines whether to enter into any final settlement, it will assess the number and identities of the\ngovernmental entities that will participate in any such settlement. The settlement agreement contemplates that if certain governmental entities do not agree to\nthe settlement, but the Company nonetheless concludes that there is sufficient participation to warrant going forward with the settlement, there would be a\ncorresponding reduction in the amount due from the Company to account for the governmental entities that did not agree. Those non-participating\ngovernmental entities would be entitled to pursue their claims against the Company and other defendants. Private plaintiff litigation will also continue.\nThe Company has been informed that 45 states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories have elected to join the settlement. Three\nstates were the subject of earlier settlements. The Company has elected to proceed with the settlement process based on that level of participation. The\nsettlement process will progress to the period during which subdivisions may elect to join.\nIn December 2022, the Company also agreed to a formal settlement agreement with a leadership group representing tribes throughout the United States. The\nagreement would resolve substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by such tribes. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be $113 million in opioid remediation and $18 million in attorneys fees and costs. The amounts would be payable over 10 years, beginning\nin 2023. The agreement is contingent upon sufficient participation by tribes.\n172\n"}]}

In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's \ninternal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening \nof the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels.

In the second quarter of 2020, we\nreduced our annual dividend to $0.01 per share in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations at that time. We maintained an annual\ndividend of $0.01 per share throughout 2022. On February 8, 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors has determined to suspend the ongoing dividends\nin light of our current preferred method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. To the extent we determine to reinstate the\ndividend in the future, the amount, declaration and payment of any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors who will\nevaluate our dividend policy from time to time based on factors it deems relevant, and the contractual limitations described below.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer\nThe following table provides information about share repurchases of our common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2022:\nPeriod\nTotal Number of\nShares Purchased\nAverage Price Paid\nper Share\nTotal Number of\nShares Purchased as\nPart of a Publicly\nAnnounced Program\nDollar Value of\nShares that May Yet\nbe Purchased Under\nthe Program\n(In thousands)\nOctober 1, 2022 October 31, 2022\n5,727,219 \n$\n31.74 \n5,727,219 \n$\n645,485 \nNovember 1, 2022 November 30, 2022\n1,259,233 \n$\n33.65 \n1,259,233 \n$\n603,108 \nDecember 1, 2022 December 31, 2022\n3,700,000 \n$\n34.61 \n3,700,000 \n$\n475,049 \nIn March 2022, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan and in February 2023, we announced that the\nBoard of Directors had authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. Under the stock repurchase plans, we may repurchase shares from time to time in the\nopen market or in privately negotiated agreements.

In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense\nand recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.","doc_name":"PFIZER_2021_10K","evidence_page_num":69,"evidence_text_full_page":"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nWe regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that\nsufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an\naudit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash\nwithin the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision\/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related\ntax liability.\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax\nbenefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the\nstatutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\nR. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental\n(non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible\ndependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial\npresent value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be\ndetermined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the\nobligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost\nof providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are\nmeasured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)\/deductionsnet.\nS. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related\nlitigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal\nand environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the\nextent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the\nrange, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range.\nWe record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\nT. Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are\ngenerally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and\/or Research\nand development expenses, as appropriate.\nNote 2.

Divestitures\nMeridian\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in\nDiscontinued operationsnet of tax. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship\nafter the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among\nother activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period.\nNo amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.\nUpjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form Viatris.\nThe Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was\nrenamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all\nof the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received\napproximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined\nwith Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any\napplicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the\nUpjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan\nshareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are\ngenerally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an\nindependent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol VTRS on the NASDAQ.\nIn connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and 3.60 billion aggregate principal\namounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan\nagreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash\ndistribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior\nunsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued\noperationsnet of tax. Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn\nfinancing arrangements.\nAs a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and\nreflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn\nBusiness, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Gains and losses from these \ntransactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating \ndecision makers assessment of segment performance. See \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" for additional information \nregarding Corporate and other results. \nCapital Expenditures and Investments \nWe continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the \ncenter of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for \ncapital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in \nInvesting Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at \nexpanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing \nin the information economy. \nGlobal Network and Technology \nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also \nbuilding our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions \nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video \nconsumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several \nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and \nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows \nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We \nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes \navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service \nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizons \nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum \nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve \nboth 4G and 5G customers. \nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks \nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. \nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and \nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio \naccess network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network \nelements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-\nefficient manner. \nConsolidated Results of Operations \nIn this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in our segment \nresults.
